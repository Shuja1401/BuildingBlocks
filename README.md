**Building Block**
This is the repository of my Python projects. These are ten basic, school-level Python projects. Each project focuses on a specific Python concept. 
The main page contains the codes of these projects. The details of each projects are provided in a small description section at the starting of each project.
The repository also has a page, *Knowledge Hub*, detailing the items, concept, theories and topics that I plan to learn as I build these projects.
The last page, *notes*, contains the other miscellenous topics, items, and ideas related to these ten projects.
