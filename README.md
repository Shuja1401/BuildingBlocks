 # Building Block
This is the repository of my Python projects. These are ten basic, school-level Python projects. Each project focuses on a specific Python concept. The main page contains the codes of these projects. The details of each projects are provided in a small description section at the starting of each project inside the README file. The repository also has a page, *Knowledge Hub*, detailing the items, concept, theories and topics that I plan to learn as I build these projects. The third folder,*parking*, contains a list of topics that I intend to study later. This is divided into two parts: To do and completed.
