### 1. **`==` for dicts ‚Üí compares keys and values (order doesn‚Äôt matter).**

In Python, the `==` operator checks if **two dictionaries have the same set of keys and matching values**.
Order of insertion doesn‚Äôt matter, only the content.

```python
a = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
b = {"age": 25, "name": "Alice"}

print(a == b)   # True ‚úÖ (same keys and values, just different order)
```

So `==` looks at **dictionary content**.

---

### 2. **`is` for dicts ‚Üí checks if both variables point to the same object in memory.**

The `is` operator checks **identity**, not content.
Two different dictionary objects can have the same content but still not be the *same* object in memory.

```python
a = {"name": "Alice"}
b = {"name": "Alice"}
c = a   # c points to the exact same object as a

print(a == b)  # True ‚úÖ (contents match)
print(a is b)  # False ‚ùå (different objects in memory)
print(a is c)  # True ‚úÖ (same object in memory)
```

So `is` looks at **object identity**.

---

### 3. **`.remove(x)` ‚Üí uses `==` under the hood.**

When you call `.remove(x)` on a list, Python scans through the list and checks each element with `==`.

* If it finds a match, it removes the **first occurrence** and stops.
* It doesn‚Äôt care about identity (`is`).

```python
contacts = [{"name": "Alice"}, {"name": "Bob"}]

# new dictionary with same content as first element
to_remove = {"name": "Alice"}  

contacts.remove(to_remove)  # Works ‚úÖ because == matches by content
print(contacts)  # [{'name': 'Bob'}]
```

But if you used `is` instead of `==`, it wouldn‚Äôt match here because the two `{"name": "Alice"}` objects are not the *same object in memory*.

---

‚ö° In short:

* `==` ‚Üí compares **values**.
* `is` ‚Üí compares **memory identity**.
* `.remove(x)` ‚Üí internally uses `==` to compare list items.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also show you the **C code from Python‚Äôs list implementation** (how `.remove()` is written under the hood) so you see the exact comparison step?
