Mutable and immutable
-- Python passes references to objects into functions.
-- If the object is mutable and you modify it, changes are visible outside. Mutable objects (list, dict, set) → changes inside a function affect the original
-- If the object is immutable or you reassign the variable, the original outside stays unchanged. Immutable objects (tuple, string, int) → changes inside a function do not affect the original.
