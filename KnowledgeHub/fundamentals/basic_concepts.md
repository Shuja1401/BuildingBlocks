Functions must be defined before you can call them.
Variables must be defined before you use them.

input() function always saves the value as a string.

In Python, *everything is an object.*
Not just instances of classes you write — literally everything: numbers, strings, lists, functions, even classes themselves.

- An object in Python is simply a chunk of data in memory that has:
- An identity → where it lives in memory (can be checked with id()).
- A type → tells what kind of object it is (checked with type()).
- A value → the actual content it holds.
